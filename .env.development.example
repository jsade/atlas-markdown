# Atlas Markdown Configuration
# https://github.com/jsade/atlas-markdown

# This scraper is designed specifically for Atlassian support documentation.
# The ATLAS_MD_BASE_URL must:
#   1. Start with "https://support.atlassian.com/"
#   2. Include a specific product endpoint (not just the root URL)
#
# REQUIRED: You must set this to specify which product documentation to fetch
# Note: This can also be provided via command-line option: atlas-markdown -u "URL"
# Valid examples:
#   - https://support.atlassian.com/jira-service-management-cloud
#   - https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud
#   - https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud
#   - https://support.atlassian.com/jira-work-management
#   - https://support.atlassian.com/trello
#   - https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud
#   - https://support.atlassian.com/statuspage
#
# Base URL for the documentation to scrape (REQUIRED - NO DEFAULT)
ATLAS_MD_BASE_URL=https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud

# Output directory for downloaded documentation. It will be created if it
# doesn't exist.
ATLAS_MD_OUTPUT_DIR=./output

# Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
ATLAS_MD_LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# Enable file logging (true/false)
# When enabled, logs will be written to files in ATLAS_MD_LOG_DIR
ATLAS_MD_LOG_ENABLED=false

# Directory for log files (created if it doesn't exist)
# Log files are named with timestamp: scraper_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.log

# =============================================================================
# You should not change the following settings unless you know what you're
#  doing. They are set to reasonable defaults for most use cases and to not
#  overload the Atlassian servers.
# =============================================================================

# Number of concurrent workers for downloading
ATLAS_MD_WORKERS=5

# Delay between requests (in seconds)
ATLAS_MD_REQUEST_DELAY=1.5

# User agent string

# ============================================
# Safety Constraints - Prevent Runaway Scraping
# ============================================

# Maximum crawl depth from the entry point (0 = unlimited)
# This prevents the scraper from following links too deep into the site
ATLAS_MD_MAX_CRAWL_DEPTH=5

# Maximum total pages to scrape (0 = unlimited)
# Hard limit to prevent accidental full-site scraping
ATLAS_MD_MAX_PAGES=1000

# Maximum time to run in minutes (0 = unlimited)
# Stops the scraper after this many minutes regardless of progress
ATLAS_MD_MAX_RUNTIME_MINUTES=120

# Maximum file size to download in MB
# Skip files larger than this to prevent disk space issues
ATLAS_MD_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=50

# Domain restriction mode (product, any-atlassian, off)
# - product: Only URLs under your specific product (recommended)
#   Example: If ATLAS_MD_BASE_URL is .../jira-service-management-cloud,
#            only allows .../jira-service-management-cloud/* URLs
# - any-atlassian: Allow any support.atlassian.com URL
#   Warning: May scrape other products' documentation!
# - off: No restriction (dangerous - not recommended)
ATLAS_MD_DOMAIN_RESTRICTION=product

# Maximum retries for failed pages
# Prevents infinite retry loops
ATLAS_MD_MAX_RETRIES=3

# Maximum consecutive failures before stopping
# Stops scraper if too many pages fail in a row (possible site issue)
ATLAS_MD_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES=20

# Enable dry run by default for safety (true/false)
# Set to false to actually download content
ATLAS_MD_DRY_RUN_DEFAULT=false

# ============================================
# Auto-Tagging Configuration
# ============================================

# Disable automatic tag generation (true/false)
# Tags are enabled by default to help organize documentation
ATLAS_MD_DISABLE_TAGS=false

# Enable semantic content analysis for enhanced tagging (true/false)
# When enabled, analyzes page content to detect technical patterns and important terms
# This provides more specific tags like 'api-reference', 'cli-usage', 'permissions-setup'
ATLAS_MD_ENABLE_CONTENT_ANALYSIS=true

# Maximum number of tags per page
ATLAS_MD_MAX_TAGS=10

# Minimum frequency for a technical term to be considered as a tag
# Only terms appearing this many times in important contexts will be used
ATLAS_MD_MIN_TERM_FREQUENCY=3

# Maximum lines of content to analyze per page (for performance)
# Set to 0 to analyze entire page
ATLAS_MD_CONTENT_ANALYSIS_DEPTH=500

# Enable technical pattern detection (true/false)
# Detects patterns like API endpoints, config files, CLI commands
ATLAS_MD_TECHNICAL_PATTERNS=true
