## I Just Have a Question

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please don't file an issue to ask a question. You'll get faster results by using the resources below.

- Read the [README.md](README.md) thoroughly - it contains detailed usage instructions and troubleshooting tips
- Check existing [Issues](https://github.com/jsade/atlas-markdown/issues) - someone might have already asked your question
- Start a [Discussion](https://github.com/jsade/atlas-markdown/discussions) for general questions and ideas

## What Should I Know Before Getting Started

### Project Overview

Atlas Markdown is a command-line tool that downloads and converts Atlassian product documentation to Markdown format. Key aspects:

- Built with Python 3.8+ for cross-platform compatibility
- Uses Playwright for handling JavaScript-rendered content
- Follows a 7-phase pipeline architecture
- Includes automatic markdown linting and formatting
- Designed for offline documentation access, particularly with Obsidian

### Design Decisions

- **Playwright over Selenium**: Better performance and reliability for modern SPAs
- **Async architecture**: Enables efficient concurrent downloads
- **SQLite for state**: Provides robust resume capability
- **Modular pipeline**: Each phase can be developed and tested independently

## How Can I Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues to avoid duplicates. When you create a bug report, include as many details as possible using the issue template.

#### How to Submit a Good Bug Report

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/jsade/atlas-markdown/issues). Create an issue and provide:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem**
- **Provide specific examples** (include links to documentation pages if relevant)
- **Describe the behavior you observed and what you expected**
- **Include logs** from verbose mode (`--verbose` flag)
- **System information**:
  - OS and version
  - Python version (`python --version`)
  - Output of `pip list` in your virtual environment
  - Browser version (`playwright --version`)

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are also tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/jsade/atlas-markdown/issues). When creating an enhancement suggestion:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Provide a detailed description** of the suggested enhancement
- **Include examples** of how the enhancement would be used
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most users
- **List any alternative solutions** you've considered

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? Look for issues labeled:

- `good first issue` - Simple issues good for beginners
- `help wanted` - Issues where we need community help
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements

#### Local Development Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/atlas-markdown.git
cd atlas-markdown
```

3. Run the initialization script:
```bash
python3 init.py
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install development dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pre-commit install
```

5. Create a branch for your feature:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Pull Requests

1. **Follow the style guides** - Use the provided linting tools
2. **Write tests** - Ensure your changes are covered by tests
3. **Update documentation** - Keep README.md and docstrings current
4. **Use conventional commits** - This enables automatic versioning
5. **Keep PRs focused** - One feature/fix per PR
6. **Add yourself to contributors** - In your first PR, add yourself to the contributors list

#### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all tests pass locally:
```bash
pytest tests/
ruff check . --fix
black .
mypy atlas_markdown/
```

2. Run a semantic release dry-run to see version impact:
```bash
semantic-release version --print
# Note: "Token value is missing!" warning is normal for local runs
```

3. Update documentation if needed
4. Submit your PR with a clear description
5. Wait for automated checks to complete
6. Address review feedback promptly

## Development Process

### Setting Up Your Environment

Detailed setup instructions are in the [README.md](README.md#development). Key points:

- Use Python 3.8+ (3.10+ recommended)
- Always work in a virtual environment
- Install pre-commit hooks for automatic code formatting
- Run `utils/test_environment.py` to verify your setup

### Code Style

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black** - Code formatting (line length: 88)
- **Ruff** - Fast Python linter
- **MyPy** - Static type checking (optional but encouraged)

Run all formatters and type checking:
```bash
black .
ruff check . --fix
mypy atlas_markdown/
```

#### Python Style Guidelines

- Follow PEP 8 with Black's formatting
- Use type hints for function parameters and returns
- Write descriptive variable names
- Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and under 50 lines when possible

### Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for automatic versioning. Use `cz commit` for an interactive commit helper.

Format: `type(scope): subject`

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature (minor version bump)
- `fix`: Bug fix (patch version bump)
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Code style (formatting, missing semicolons, etc)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding or correcting tests
- `build`: Changes to build system or dependencies
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration
- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

**Examples:**
```
feat(parser): add support for Confluence diagrams
fix(scraper): handle rate limiting for large wikis
docs: update troubleshooting section
perf(images): implement concurrent image downloads
```

### Testing

Write tests for new functionality:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_parser.py -v

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=atlas_markdown tests/

# Run only fast tests
pytest -m "not slow"
```

#### Writing Tests

- Place tests in `tests/` mirroring the source structure
- Use descriptive test names: `test_parser_handles_empty_content()`
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Mock external dependencies (network calls, file system)
- Use fixtures for common test data
